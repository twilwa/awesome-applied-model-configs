This is an [awesome-list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) related to the operation and application of generative AI models. Resources here will be broken up into sections such as frameworks for model operations (ComfyUI, autogen, DSPy, langchain, etc) with corresponding configurations, cookbooks, and examples for each framework. The target audience is developers and semi-technicals who are looking for a centralized index of resources to bootstrap useful configurations for various AI-powered applications.
